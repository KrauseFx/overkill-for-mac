## Introduction

Overkill is a simple, elegant Mac app, that runs in the background and makes sure iTunes never interrupts your work.
And for those movie nights where you actually want to use iTunes, just click on `Pause Overkill` and enjoy the evening.

If you have other apps you don’t want to launch automatically (e.g. Photos app), you can add those apps to the Overkill list as well.
